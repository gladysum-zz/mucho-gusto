# Mucho Gusto

Practice your Spanish conversation skills with Mucho Gusto, a chatbot powered by IBM Watson Conversation Service!

## Inspiration
I was inspired by watching demos of the IBM Watson Robot. I was extremely impressed by the natural language processing capabilities of the Watson Robot. It immediately fired off my imagination. I've always been passionate about tech and languages. I'm fluent in Spanish, having been born in Argentina (I moved to the US from Argentina when I was five). Building a Spanish-language chatbot was the perfect way to combine my two passions.
## What it does
Mucho Gusto is a web-based app for people who want to practice their Spanish conversation skills. It leverages the natural language processing capabilities of IBM Watson.
## How I built it
I wrote the conversation logic using IBM Watson Conversation API. I built the backend using JavaScript, Node, and Express. I developed the frontend using React, React-Redux, React-Router-Dom, HTML, and CSS. 
## Challenges I ran into
I built Mucho Gusto's UI in the React framework, a wonderful frontend framework that also happens to be a relatively new technology that is rapidly evolving. I had to learn the syntax of new technologies within the React framework while building my app.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I created a whimsical user interface and a fun conversation bot that impressed many people.
## What I learned
I learned how to use IBM Watson Conversation Service.
## What's next for Mucho Gusto
Making the conversation logic more complex and nuanced, and making the chatbot more entertaining and educational for the user!
